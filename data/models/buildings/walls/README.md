# Layered walls

18 GLBs across six wall families, used by the 3D board and editor.
Selection uses **pristine map CF** (`BLDG_CF`); combat damage does not change the family.
Editor CF changes select a new family when crossing a bracket. Explicit model overrides retain their appearance.

## Families

| Folder | Pristine CF | Design |
|---|---:|---|
| `civilian/` | 1–10 | Narrow scaffold frame, wire fencing, barbed wire and diamond-plate deck. |
| `light/` | 11–15 | Corrugated steel, light framing and cross braces. |
| `medium/` | 16–40 | Paneled concrete sides, flat concrete roofs, recessed buttresses and a central roof strip. |
| `heavy/` | 41–90 | Concrete and gunmetal armor, with two roof vent strips. |
| `hardened/` | 91–150 | Charcoal gunmetal body, alternating armor panels and deep pillars, with three roof strips. |
| `castle_brian/` | 151+ | Darkest gunmetal tier, with massive buttresses, broad pillar crowns and reinforced roof panels. |

Each folder contains:

- `straight.glb` — a repeating straight section, north to south.
- `pier.glb` — a hexagonal junction with a north arm.
- `terminal.glb` — a hexagonal endpoint whose exit and arm face north.

The arms are connected-kit pieces (`../README.md`): each module has a `-link-n` node running from the junction
to the north edge midpoint, and the runtime turns it onto every connected exit. A lone wall's terminal faces south.

All families have matching opposing faces and walkable roofs. Piers and terminals have no turret.
The five military families include red emissive fixtures.

## Layers, LODs and materials

Each GLB contains `<filename>-lod0` and `<filename>-lod1` roots, each with mesh children
ending in `-base0`, `-floor0` and `-roof0` (and their `-link-n` arms). LOD0 is detailed; LOD1 reduces geometry.
Both groups occupy the same position; display one at a time.

Base and floor layers are **18 units high**. A height-N wall uses one base, N−1 repeating
floors and a roof at N×18. Roof rails, parapets and lights extend above that height.
Files store a height-2 assembly: base at 0, floor at 18 and roof at 36 along glTF's Y-up axis.
The runtime grounds each module on its lowest point, its arm included, preserving its texture scale.

Textures are embedded PNGs using glTF metallic/roughness, normal and emissive materials, except two shared board
materials (`data/models/board/textures/structures/common`): the light walls' `corrugated` steel and every deck's
`diamond-plate`. A deck holds 8 plate repeats along a 72-unit section, so sections join without a seam; the
hardened and Castle Brian decks darken the plate with vertex colours.
Civilian fence and barbed-wire surfaces use alpha masking at a 0.5 cutoff; other surfaces
are opaque. No required glTF extensions are needed.

## Dimensions and repetition

- Straight sections are 72 units long. Arms run from the junction, 25 units from the centre (civilian 17.5),
  to the edge midpoint 36 units out.
- Military decks are 30 units wide; civilian decks are 21 units wide (70%).
- Military junctions measure 52 units across flats; civilian junctions measure 36.4.
  Civilian arms therefore start nearer the centre.
- Civilian posts repeat every 18 units; joining half-posts form a full post.
  Straight-section width including foot pads is 22.5 units.
- Castle Brian straight sections have 14.4-unit-wide pillars at ±18 along their length.
  Repeating sections maintains a 36-unit pillar pitch across joins. Each arm has one centered buttress.
- Floor top and bottom profiles match for vertical repetition. Straight-section end profiles
  join without transverse roof caps.

## Geometry budgets

Triangle counts per height-2 file (base + one floor + roof, arms included), **LOD0 / LOD1**:

| Family | Pier | Straight | Terminal |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Civilian | 3,920 / 1,736 | 2,796 / 852 | 3,940 / 1,756 |
| Light | 3,644 / 1,072 | 2,288 / 588 | 3,692 / 1,072 |
| Medium | 2,768 / 1,104 | 1,476 / 624 | 2,744 / 1,104 |
| Heavy | 2,656 / 1,212 | 1,624 / 588 | 2,704 / 1,212 |
| Hardened | 4,284 / 2,520 | 2,556 / 1,200 | 4,332 / 2,520 |
| Castle Brian | 3,852 / 2,408 | 2,152 / 968 | 3,864 / 2,420 |

A drawn pier or terminal is its core plus one arm per exit.
