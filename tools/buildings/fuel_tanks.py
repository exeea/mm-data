"""Fuel tank kits: round tanks joined by pipes, on the board's shared materials.

    python tools/buildings/fuel_tanks.py [weight ...]

Writes data/models/buildings/fuel_tanks/fuel_tank_<weight>.glb, connected kits (see data/models/buildings/README.md)
stacked as built: the base (first course, from the ground), a floor (a further course), the domed roof, the north pipe
(`link-n`) and the blind flange where no pipe leaves (`end-n`), in three levels of detail (the props' rule: above 80
pixels on screen, down to 24, below). The designer's kits set the sizes, the paint and the roof's rings, bolts and
seams. The light and medium tanks are banded: a painted shell on a steel plinth, with grey rings standing out from
it. The heavy and hard tanks are clad: painted cladding standing out from the shell, with painted panels let into it
in bays, and on the hard tank pressed vents between them. Painted parts take `weathered-paint` and vents
`vent-slots`, both tinted by vertex colour; steel parts take `rusted-steel`. Vertex colours also carry contact
shading and grime.
