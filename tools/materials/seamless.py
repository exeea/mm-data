"""Make aligned fields tile without a seam, all of them by the same operation (needs numpy and scipy).

seamless(stack, weights): stack is H x W x C floats (every map or source field of one material, aligned); weights
gives each channel's say in where the cut runs. Each axis in turn, the texture and a copy rolled by half a tile: their
broad component (a wrapped Gaussian) cross-fades from the copy at the tile's edges to the texture in its middle, and
their fine grain switches from one to the other along a minimum-error cut, so stones and grit stay whole instead of
ghosting. Neither the texture's edges nor the copy's (which lie in the tile's middle) survive, so whatever seam or
edge ramp the texture had goes with them.
