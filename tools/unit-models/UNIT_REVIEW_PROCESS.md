# Unit review process

How a chassis gets authored, reviewed and signed off. [MODELLING_GUIDE.md](MODELLING_GUIDE.md) holds the
house rules for the artwork itself; this file holds the working loop and the review conventions agreed
while building them. Everything here came from real review rounds, so treat it as binding.

## 1. The loop

Two catalogs are prerequisites. Re-export them only when MegaMek's equipment or unit files change.

```bash
./gradlew :megamek:exportEquipmentModelCatalog :megamek:exportMekModelCatalog --console=plain
```

They land in `mm-data/.work/modular-models/equipment.json` and `mm-data/.work/mek-models/catalog.json`.
Nothing downstream runs without them.

| Step | Command | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Author the body | `tools/unit_mek_chassis.py`: a `def <id>(g)` plus an entry in the `builders` dict | - |
| Write the recipe | `tools/unit-models/chassis.json`: hip, eight sockets, mount areas | - |
| Export | `python tools/build_modular_unit_models.py` | 11 s |
| Review the bare body | `blender --background --factory-startup --python tools/render_modular_body.py -- --body <id> --turn 60` | 10 s |
| Register | one `chassis` line in `data/images/units/mekset.txt` | - |
| Validate | `./gradlew :megamek:test --tests "*UnitModelDescriptorTest*"` | 6 min |
| Review assembled | `./gradlew :megamek:gpuBoardSmoke --tests '*GpuModularUnitModelsSmokeTest*'` | 2 min |

The middle three rows are the iteration loop, about twenty seconds a round. Expect several rounds;
the Archer took five. Send a sheet each round.

Assembled review images land in `megamek/build/gpu-board-review/`. A chassis with no frozen legacy bake
gets a `runtime-new-<id>` pair of its own; one with a bake gets `runtime-compare-<id>`.

**Three tools are legacy and must not be used on modular assets:** `build_unit_models.py`,
`render_unit_variants.py` and `validate_unit_models.py`. All three still expect schema 1 and the baked
variant layout.

## 2. The review sheet

`render_modular_body.py` renders the deployed schema-2 body. Standard sheet, every round, no exceptions:

**Front, Back, Left, Right, Above, Three-quarter**, on a three-by-two grid.

### The three renders to ask for

| Ask for | What it shows | Produced by |
|---|---|---|
| **the chassis** | bare body, six angles, no loadout | `render_modular_body.py` |
| **the chassis with weapons** | one variant assembled, six angles | `renderFullReview` |
| **the variant sheet** | every variant of the chassis in a grid, one angle each, with triangle counts | `GpuVariantSheetReview` |
| **the lineup** | several bodies of the same family side by side, one camera, feet on one ground line | `render_modular_body.py --lineup` |

The variant sheet is the comparison view: it shows the shared body under every loadout the game will
hang on it, so a specific variant can be picked out for a closer render. It writes
`variants-<Chassis>.png`, eight across, sorted by model, headed with the count and the triangle range.
It renders to an off-screen framebuffer, so the sheet is not limited to the 1280x800 window.

A **full render** means all six of those angles on one sheet. Two renderers produce one:

- **Bare body:** `render_modular_body.py` writes `<id>-review.png`, labelled, three across.
- **Assembled, with weapons:** `renderFullReview` in the native smoke test writes
  `runtime-new-<label>-full.png`, same three-across order, **unlabelled**. Read it as
  front, back, left on the top row; right, above, three-quarter on the bottom.

Give every test unit a full render, not just the chassis it was authored from. Each variant hangs a
different loadout on the same body, which is the only way to see whether a pod suits a PPC as well as
an autocannon.

A **lineup** answers a different question from a sheet: whether a body reads at the right weight
beside its neighbours. Nothing is centred on its own bounds - every body stands on the same ground
line at the same scale, because the comparison is the point.

```bash
blender --background --factory-startup --python tools/render_modular_body.py --     --lineup heavy-lineup --body warhammer --tons 70 --body rifleman --tons 60 --body archer --tons 70
```

Run one for every new chassis against two neighbours of similar tonnage, and read it for **width,
depth and limb mass**, not height. The guide is explicit that mass is carried by silhouette rather
than by making light units small, and the measured heights mislead on their own: the Rifleman at 53.0
reads plainly lighter than the Warhammer at 52.0, and correctly so.

### Height is measured to the body, not to a wire

The weight-standard rule that "antennas must not be used to inflate a bare body's apparent weight
class" means **wire-style antennas** - the thin whips on the Archer's head - not a structural sensor
or communications assembly. A mast carrying a housing and a crossbar is body; a wire is not.

This matters because it changes who is passing honestly:

| Chassis | Measured | Actual body | Difference |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Archer | 61.5 | 55.0 | 6.5 of wire antenna |
| Rifleman | 53.0 | 53.0 | none; the crossbar is structural |
| Warhammer | 52.0 | 52.0 | none |

So the Archer is the one whose number is flattered, and the Warhammer is genuinely under its band at
70 tons. Measure the tallest `paint`/`edge` part, not the overall bounds, before deciding a body
misses its band.

`--turn <deg>` adds a second sheet for the waist-twist gate: the upper body rotates about the recipe's
hip point while hips and legs stay put. Nothing above the waist may cut through the hips or legs, and no
gap may open between them.

View conventions, verified against geometry that exists on one side only (the Mackie's shield disc rings
its right arm):

- **Front:** the unit faces you, so its right side is on the image left.
- **Back:** its right side is on the image right.
- **Above:** looking down, nose up the page, its right on the image right. Same convention as the
  84x72 game sprite, which makes the two directly comparable.
- Each cell is centred on its own posed bounds, so a plan view does not float against an elevation.

## 3. Markup conventions

Mark up the rendered sheet and send it back. Marks are located to the pixel and mapped to authored
numbers, so rough boxes are fine.

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Red box** | **Always a sizing change.** May indicate both size and basic shape. |

Rules that go with a red box:

- **Tapering stays.** Any taper, step or bevel already authored is preserved through a resize unless
  it is specifically called out. A resize scales what is there; it does not flatten it.
- **Two boxes on the same part from different views are one instruction**, not two. Front and Back both
  measure width and height, so a pair of boxes is a cross-check; average them.
- **Which edges the box shares with the part carries meaning.** A box whose bottom sits on the part's
  bottom edge means take the change off the top.

### Vocabulary

Direction is given in plain words. This maps them to the control that actually changes.

| You say | Control | Value |
|---|---|---|
| lineup | several same-family bodies side by side at one scale | `render_modular_body.py --lineup` |
| full render | all six angles of one unit on one sheet | bare body: `render_modular_body.py`; assembled: `renderFullReview` |
| the chassis | the bare body, no loadout | `render_modular_body.py` |
| the chassis with weapons | one variant assembled | `renderFullReview` |
| variant sheet | every variant in a grid, for comparison | `GpuVariantSheetReview` |
| flush, recessed, flat against the body | `protrusion` for that location | `recessed` (0.06) |
| barely proud, stubby | `protrusion` | `short` (0.4) |
| standing out | `protrusion` | `medium` (0.7) |
| reaching well ahead | `protrusion` | `long` (1.0) |
| longer / shorter barrel than standard | `weaponOverrides` `length` for that location and family | authoring units, scaled by `weaponScale` |
| bigger / smaller guns overall | `weaponScale` | 0.83 (Atlas) to 0.95 (Mad Cat, Mackie, Rifleman) |
| closer to / further from a feature | the location's socket in `sockets` | sprite x, sprite y, height |

**flush and recessed mean the same thing.** Both map to `protrusion: recessed`.

Terms are recorded here as they come up rather than agreed in advance; add a row when a new one lands.

### Measuring a marked box

Never eyeball it. Establish the scale from a known dimension in the same render:

1. Measure the model's silhouette width in pixels for one panel.
2. Divide by the body's known width in authoring units (from `manifest.json` bounds).
3. Apply that pixels-per-unit figure to the box.

Worked example, Rifleman arm pod: the Front panel measured 353 px across a known 41-unit width, giving
**8.61 px per unit**. The two boxes measured 72x99 and 66x104 px, or 8.4x11.5 and 7.7x12.1 units,
averaging **8.0 x 11.8**. Against a pod then 10 x 15, that is a uniform 0.79 scale holding the
authored 2/3 width-to-height proportion.

## 4. How weapons are placed

### Deciding where a socket goes

Four steps, in order. Skipping straight to "what looks right in the render" is what produces a mount
that is plausible from one angle and wrong from every other.

1. **The MTF owns the location.** Read the unit file and put the weapon on the location it names.
   A location is a gameplay fact, not a composition choice: it decides what is destroyed when that
   part is destroyed. Never move a weapon to a neighbouring location because the artwork reads
   better there - move the socket *within* its own location instead. The BattleMaster's rear medium
   lasers are one in each side torso, not a pair in the centre torso, however much they look like a
   centred pair in the artwork.
2. **Start at the centre of that location's own facing.** Not the centre of the unit, and not the
   centre of a bounding box - the area-weighted centre of the faces that point the way the weapon
   fires. Measure it; do not estimate it from a render. A location's front facing and its rear
   facing have different centres.
3. **Then read the count and the size.** Two mediums on one facing need different spacing from one
   large. Space them so they neither overlap nor drift off the panel, and so the group stays centred
   on the facing. `mountAreas` decides how a group arranges itself: a tall narrow area stacks
   over-under, a wide one sets them abreast.
4. **Only then follow reference artwork**, if any exists, and only within the location the MTF gave.

### Flush means the model sits on the surface

**A flush mount puts the bottom of the equipment model on top of the armour it mounts to.** Not
sunk into it, not hovering above it. A launcher bay whose lower row of tubes disappears into the
shoulder is wrong, and so is one floating a unit clear of it. Work it from the geometry: measure the
surface the thing sits on, measure the model's own height, and place the socket so the two meet.

Guessing a number, rendering, and nudging is the slow way round and it has repeatedly taken three
attempts when one measurement would have done.

### The mechanism

A hard point names where a weapon leaves the armour, and `mountAreas` gives the facing it is laid out
on. The runtime fitter then places the location's weapons on that facing.

**Weapons sharing a hard point are centred on it as a group.** Their heights are summed with a 0.4 gap,
the stack is centred on the facing, and the largest sits on top. Without this the first weapon took the
socket and the rest were pushed clear of it, so a pair hung below the middle of its facing.

A single weapon still sits exactly on its hard point, which is already the centre of its facing. Bay
launchers arrange their own rows and are left alone. A weapon that cannot fit is shrunk through fixed
steps, and only then moved.

**Left and right mirror; they never copy.** When a crowded weapon has to step aside, it steps toward
the Mek's centre line, worked out for each face in its own frame. Any rule with a direction - an offset,
a scan order, a preferred side - is stated relative to the centre line, never as a fixed +x or -x, and is
checked by measuring both sides against the centre line. The BattleMaster's side-torso lasers once sat
12.9 px further out on one side because the packer always stepped to local -x.

### Guns held in the hand

A Mek whose recipe lists an arm in `heldWeapons` holds its large weapons in that fist as a gun instead
of growing them out of the forearm. The design is modular: nothing about it is authored per chassis.

- **Which weapons.** Mek-mountable PPCs, autocannons (including LB-X, Ultra, rotary and hypervelocity),
  Gauss rifles and large lasers, listed under `held` in `weapons.json`. Machine guns, small and medium
  lasers, flamers and launchers keep their ordinary shape. Infantry and battle armour weapons are
  excluded by requiring `F_MEK_WEAPON`, since name matching alone catches gauss pistols and support PPCs.
- **The chassis supplies the gun body.** The exporter measures that chassis's own forearm end and hand
  and generates `<arm>@held`: flush on the forearm end and the same size as it, long enough to cover
  where the hand was, with a raised deck and a grip. It is optional anatomy like the hand.
- **The weapon supplies the barrel.** Each qualifying weapon gets a `held` profile: a collar, a barrel
  and one feature per family - coils on a PPC, twin rails on a Gauss rifle, a thick muzzle ring on an
  autocannon, a lens housing on a large laser. Sizes come from the weapon, so a Heavy PPC carries a
  bigger barrel than a Light PPC. It is built at its finished size; barrel length overrides do not
  stretch it.
- **In game,** an arm holding a gun shows the gun body and loses its hand; any other arm keeps its hand.
  Every weapon in that hand leaves from the gun body's front face. Two held weapons in one hand stack
  over-under like a double-barrelled gun, the larger on top.
- **An arm with no hand keeps its ordinary barrel.** Only a hand can hold a gun.

To give another chassis held guns, add `"heldWeapons": ["LA", "RA"]` to its recipe. Its arms need
`@forearm` and `@hand` parts; the export stops with an error if an arm lists held weapons without them.
Review the result with `render_modular_body.py --equipment <name> --profile held` for one barrel, or
`--held-all <sheet> --angle 120` for every distinct held barrel side-on.

Review images are named for the unit they show, not the body they were authored from:
`runtime-new-Rifleman RFL-3N-full.png`. Every sheet also carries the chassis and model **in the top
right of the image**, so a render stays identifiable once it leaves the build directory. A bare-body
sheet uses the chassis name from the recipe, since it has no variant.

## 5. Vents

Vents are the standard surface detail for a torso, and they read far better than a box stood off the
armour. A vent is a shaded recess behind three lit fins, drawn as flat panels lying in the skin:
`dark` backing at 0.06 proud, `edge` fins at 0.16. Eight triangles each.

Use them sparingly. The limits:

- **At most two on the front** and **at most two on the back**.
- **Back vents only on torso locations.**
- **Put them where the heat sinks are.** The mek catalog records a location for every heat sink that
  takes a critical slot, so placement is a lookup rather than a judgement. Most sinks are engine ones
  carrying no location at all - ignore those and count only the slotted ones. For the vents the
  author draws, count across every variant; at runtime each variant then moves its vents to its own
  heat sinks (see "Weapons first, vents after" below).

| Chassis | Located sinks by location | Vents go |
|---|---|---|
| Rifleman | LT 25, RT 24, LL 12, RL 10, CT 5 | LT and RT |
| BattleMaster | RT 37, LT 23, LA 20, RA 14, CT 7 | LT and RT |

  Then keep them clear of that location's hard point: the Rifleman mounts a flush medium laser in
  each side torso at z 37.9, so its vents sit low at 30.9-33.4 and the two never meet.

**Weapons first, vents after.** A weapon drawn over a vent makes no sense, and the body cannot know
where a variant's weapons go, because every variant shares it. So on a modular body a vent is a spot,
not armour:

- The vents the author draws are the chassis's first choice. `unit_mek_vents.finish_vents` adds up to
  three spare spots on the flat of each torso face, sized like the authored vents (smaller where a
  location is narrow). A spare on the left torso is always the right torso's spare mirrored.
- At runtime the variant's weapons are placed first. Then the vents go in the torsos holding that
  variant's slotted heat sinks, read from its unit file: the two torsos with the most, or both vents in
  one when only one holds any. A variant with no slotted torso sinks keeps the author's vents where the
  author put them.
- Each vent takes the first spot in its torso that no weapon covers and no other vent has taken. If
  every spot is covered, the vent is left off. Unused spots are removed.
- Each decision is logged at debug level ("Vent kept at...", "covered by a weapon", "left off").
- **Legs, front only.** A chassis may also draw vents on the front of its shins (`vent(..., group='LL-shin')`);
  a variant with heat sinks slotted in its legs then gets them there (the Griffin GRF-1S). Legs never take
  back vents, and a chassis with no leg spots behaves as before.
- **No slotted sinks, no vents.** A recipe's `"ventDefaultSides": []` leaves a variant whose sinks all sit in
  the engine bare, so the vents shown always match the unit file (the Griffin).

**Chassis equipment rules.** A recipe's `equipmentRules` draws one weapon with another weapon's art at
a spot of its own: which weapon (`match`, `exclude`), which art (`drawAs`), which profile, and where
(`socket`, `node`, `size`). The weapon keeps its own location for damage. The Atlas draws every LRM 20
as an LRM 5 rack stood on end at the right of its waist block, seen from the front.

Two things to get right, both learned the hard way on the Rifleman:

- **Follow the skin's slope.** A torso that lofts from 13 deep to 14.5 over six units of height moves
  its face 0.125 per unit. A panel at one fixed depth is half buried and half floating.
- **Stay inside the flat part of the face.** A bevelled section chamfers its corners, so the flat band
  is narrower than the section width: a `cut` of 0.3 on a 17-wide, 13.7-deep section leaves only about
  +/-6.4 flat. Geometry outside that band hangs off the chamfer and reads as stuck on.
- Winding reverses on the back so the panels still face outward.

## 5a. Jump jets

**One jump jet graphic per location.** The graphic says a location has jump jets; it does not count them.
A location whose unit file lists three jump jets shows one nozzle, not three. The first jet in each location
is drawn at that location's `exhaustSockets` spot; the others are bound to it with no mesh of their own, so
every working jet still fires its exhaust from the shared nozzle when the unit jumps, and a destroyed extra
jet never shows the drawn one as wrecked. MegaMek applies this to every chassis
(`UnitEquipmentAssembly.shareJumpJets`); a chassis does nothing to opt in.

Put `exhaustSockets` on the back of each torso location and the back of the calves, clear of the back vents
(jets are placed before vents, so a vent a jet covers is left off). Before this rule, the Griffin GRF-4R's four
right-torso jets ran in a column from the shoulder to the thigh. `jumpJetScale` draws a chassis's jets smaller
than its weapons where the nozzle crowds the back.

## 6. Torso locations must be real

The guide requires actual drawable `HD`, `CT`, `LT` and `RT` surface, and forbids labelling a joined
torso as `CT`. Two things enforce it:

- **The compile step refuses a joined torso.** A centre section may not reach past 75 per cent of the
  torso's half-width. Existence alone never caught this: a chassis can carry an `LT` shoulder pod - a
  real `LT` face - while its entire torso skin stays `CT`, so the side blows off and the armour over
  it remains. The Archer, Mad Cat, Marauder and King Crab all shipped in that state; the Archer's
  centre reached 13.5 of a 14.2 half-width.
- **`split_torso_locations()` is a migration helper, and runs once per body.** Its old guard skipped
  any body that already had an `LT` face - which is every body with a shoulder, so the bodies that
  most needed splitting were the ones that never got it.

**A new body declares its seam:** `split_torso_locations(g, seam=4.2)`. The seam is a fact about the
design - where the chest stops and the arm-carrying structure starts - not a fraction of whatever the
shell happens to measure. Call it before any `LT`/`RT` accessory is authored, so the shoulder does not
end up as the location's only geometry.

## 7. Arms that flip

A Mek with no lower arm or hand actuators can flip its arms to fire behind it, and the renderer shows
it: the arms turn about each shoulder's own left-right axis, rising forward, over the shoulder and
down to point rearward.

**That axis never changes x.** So an arm that is flush with its shoulder at rest is flush at every
angle of the turn, and an arm buried inside its shoulder sweeps through solid armour halfway over.
The rule follows: **a shoulder ends where its arm begins.**

Check it on any body with arms, before review:

```
right pod      x 12.75 .. 21.25
right shoulder x  3.25 .. 12.75   -> flush, gap 0.00
```

Reducing a shoulder to meet its arm need not narrow the unit. On the Rifleman the shoulder went from
`3.5..18.5` to `3.25..12.75` while the pod stayed at `12.75..21.25`: same overall width, and the pods
read as separate objects hung on the shoulders rather than merging into one slab.

Every chassis except the Rifleman still buries its arm joint, by 0.5 (Mackie) to 5.3 (Mad Cat). They
render correctly at rest and will show the arm passing through the shoulder when flipped.

## 8. Budget

Bare unit before loadout: **target under 1,000 triangles**, hard cap 1,500. A thousand is available and
may be spent on detail; there is no virtue in coming in far under. Equipment is counted separately and
never consumes the body allowance: each module targets under 100 triangles and must stay under 150.

Report body, equipment and assembled totals separately. The exporter prints the body count and the
manifest records it per asset.

## 9. Calibration by tonnage

Legs are the easiest thing to overbuild. Check a new chassis against what is already in
`unit_mek_chassis.py` before trusting your own eye:

| Chassis | Tons | Hip x | Foot |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Warhammer | 70 | 7.5 | 9 x 12 |
| Archer | 70 | 8 | 11 x 15 |
| Rifleman | 60 | 7.5 | 9.5 x 13 |

A sixty-tonner with a wider stance and a bigger foot than either seventy-tonner is wrong, however good
it looks in isolation.

**Height by weight class.** Scale 1.0 is exactly two board levels. The board draws a Mek at 1/27 level
per model unit, so 1.0 is 54 units. Measure to the top of the armour, ignoring antennas, whips and
dishes. Keep every Mek of a class inside its band so the class reads as one size:

| Class | Scale | Model units | Set so far (scale) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Light | 0.75-0.80 | 40.5-43.2 | Locust 0.791, Panther 0.793 |
| Medium | 0.82-0.87 | 44.3-47.0 | |
| Heavy | 0.89-0.94 | 48.1-50.8 | Rifleman 0.914, Warhammer 0.924, Mad Cat 0.924, Archer 0.931, Marauder 0.933 |
| Assault | 0.95-1.00 | 51.3-54.0 | King Crab 0.966, BattleMaster 0.981, Mackie 0.985, Atlas 0.991 |

**Within a band, order by the official miniature.** `BTMmm.xlsx` in the mm-data root lists 206 official
minis with their height in mm. A chassis takes the point in its band that its mini's height holds in the
spread of minis of the same class: the tallest heavy mini lands near 0.94, the shortest near 0.89. A
chassis with no mini in the sheet is placed by eye (the Mackie sits just under the Atlas).

Fix a body's height with the recipe's `bodyScale`, never by re-authoring it. The whole body scales
evenly after every joint is placed, and the exporter scales the recipe's sockets, mount areas, weapon
sizes and barrel lengths by the same amount, so nothing is re-measured. The board's own runtime scale
stays at a neutral 1.0 for later fine-tuning.

**Mount settings a recipe can use.**
- `hangingMounts`: the socket marks an underside, and the weapon hangs from it with its top against it.
- `stackRows`: weapons sharing a socket sit side by side, centred, a new row below when the face is
  full; the left side mirrors the right. Without it they stack over-under.
- `sharedFaces`: one location's weapons pack onto another location's face beside its own, as the
  Locust's head and centre torso share the chin turret.
- `equipmentRules`: one weapon drawn with another's art at a spot of its own (the Atlas LRM 20).

## 10. Per-chassis decisions

### Rifleman (60 t, `rifleman`)

**Signed off 2026-09-20 at 674 triangles. Preserved in `preserved/rifleman-final/`.** Treat it as the
worked example for the rules below; change it only against a new reference, not on taste.

- **No variant has a hand or a lower arm.** All 27 carry their weapons at the elbow, so each arm is a
  weapon pod rather than a limb. No forearm or fist is authored.
- **Every variant carries two weapons per arm.** The pod's mount area is taller than it is wide, so the
  pair stacks over-under, matching the line art.
- No variant mounts a rear-facing weapon; 27 mounts are jump jets, which ride in the calves.
- Radar: a swept blade on a short mast, centred, angle approved at review. The game sprite puts a
  two-pronged array right of centre; the miniature and the approved artwork win.
- Barrels are lengthened in the recipe (`weaponOverrides`, ballistic 21, laser 18) because the standard
  shapes read as stubs on a design whose identity is its guns.
- The head runs the full length of the centre torso rather than perching on it, which needs an
  `upright` loft: the front face has to move with height, and a `forward` loft can only taper. Chin
  squared at z 31.5, cockpit standing 4.5 clear of the chest, crown falling back into the antenna.
- **Shoulders stop at 12.75, where the arm pods start.** See the arm flip rule below.
