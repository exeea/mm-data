"""Vent spots for a modular Mek body, chosen at runtime after the weapons are placed.

A vent is surface detail, a weapon is equipment, and a weapon drawn over a vent reads as nonsense. The body is
shared by every variant of a chassis while the weapons differ per variant, so the body cannot know where its
vents belong. It offers spots instead: the vents the chassis author drew, which are its first choice, and a few
more found on the flat of each torso face. The runtime places the variant's weapons, then keeps the vents that
land in a torso holding the variant's heat sinks and clear of its weapons.

Every spot is its own node under its torso location, so a spot the runtime does not keep is simply detached,
and one that is kept goes with its location when that location is destroyed.
